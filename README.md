## üí° How It Works

1. **User Login**: Secure login for students and administrators with token-based authentication using JWT.
2. **Extracurricular Participation**: Students earn points for participating in activities, which are processed via the backend.
3. **Transaction Processing**: Using MongoDB with ACID transactions, all payments are reliably handled, and any failure triggers a rollback to ensure data consistency.
4. **Role-Based Access**: ZOD ensures secure validation of inputs, and only authorized users can access certain features of the app.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Future Roadmap

- **Integration with External Payment Gateways**: Add support for real-money rewards with Stripe or PayPal.
- **Expanded Activity Tracking**: Introduce more ways for students to earn points, such as academic achievements.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms.
